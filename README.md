### LSHTM-RUG does Advent-of-Code

Please visit the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about) site to familiarize yourself with the event and get useful tips. 

Fork this repository, it could serve as the structure to help keep your AoC code organized...

Join the LSHTM-RUG [board](https://adventofcode.com/2025/leaderboard/private) with this code: **5153206-c60513a8**

Practice on previous [puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2025/events), solutions are available (e.g. [here](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/rstats-adventofcode/2024.html))

Wait for the 1st Dec. 2025 midnight EST (UTC-5), or run `NextPuzzleWhen.R`

Complete one or both sections of the daily puzzles to get stars on the board. One star for each section, in case of a tie the fastest completions win.

Share your solution(s) by submitting a pull request once you have put your script(s) inside a folder that identifies you (e.g. with your github username), and within the corresponding day in `AoC2025/`. For example I would submit a PR like this `AoC2025/Day01/rug-lshtm/day01_solutions.R`

*It is important that you put your scripts in your own folder each day to avoid conflicts and keep everything readable. Also, please [do not include the input.txt files](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs/).*

The board leaders will receive a small R-related (but physical) gift for their dedication and recognition at our first 2026 meeting.
