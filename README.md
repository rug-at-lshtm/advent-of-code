### LSHTM-RUG does Advent-of-Code.

Welcome to the LSHTM RUG Advent of Code 2025! Advent of code is a Christmas-themed coding challenge with 12 small programming puzzles to complete throughout December. The RUG leaderboard winners will receive a small R-related (but physical) gift for their dedication and recognition at our first 2026 meeting.

To participate:
1. Fork this repository. You can use it as the structure to help keep your AoC code organized.
2. Join the LSHTM-RUG [board](https://adventofcode.com/2025/leaderboard/private) with this code: **5153206-c60513a8**
3. To find out when the next puzzle is out: wait for the 1st Dec. 2025 midnight EST (UTC-5), or run `NextPuzzleWhen.R`
4. Each time a puzzle comes out, complete one or both sections.
5. Share your solution(s) by submitting a pull request once you have put your script(s) inside a folder that identifies you (e.g. with your github username), and within the corresponding day in `AoC2025/`. For example I would submit a pull request like this `AoC2025/Day01/rug-lshtm/day01_solutions.R`
6. (add something about how it is scored)
   
Reminders/tips: 
1. *It is important that you put your scripts in your own folder each day to avoid conflicts and keep everything readable. Also, please [do not include the input.txt files](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs/).*
2. Practice on previous [puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2025/events), solutions are available (e.g. [here](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/rstats-adventofcode/2024.html))
