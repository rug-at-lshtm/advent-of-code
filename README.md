### LSHTM-RUG does Advent of Code.

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about) is a coding challenge with small programming puzzles to complete throughout December. The RUG leaderboard winners will receive a small R-related (but physical) gift for their dedication, and recognition at the first meeting of the year.

**To participate:**

1\. [Create an account on the AoC site](https://adventofcode.com/2025/auth/login)

2\. Join the LSHTM-RUG [board](https://adventofcode.com/2025/leaderboard/private) with the code: **5153206-c60513a8**

3\. Each time a puzzle comes out, starting 1st Dec. at midnight EST (UTC-5), complete one or both sections to get one or two stars. In case of a tie, an earlier completion wins.

4\. Most stars on December 31st wins (this means you can complete all the puzzles at your own pace while hiding from your holiday duties!)

**To share your solutions:**

1\. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository. You can also use it as the structure to help keep your AoC code organized.

2\. In your fork, create a folder within the puzzle-day, and name it after yourself (e.g. `AoC2025/Day01/my-GH-username`)

3\. Add your solution scripts to that folder (e.g. `AoC2025/Day01/my-GH-username/my-nice-solution.R`)

4\. Submit a [pull-request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

*It is important that you put your scripts within a personal folder to avoid conflicts and keep everything readable. Also, please [do not include the input.txt files](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs/).*

**Tips**

\- Browse the [AoC site](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about) to get familiar with the format

\- Practice on previous [puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2025/events), solutions are available (e.g. [here](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/rstats-adventofcode/2024.html))

\- Pen, paper and [rubberducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) can be helpful when stuck
